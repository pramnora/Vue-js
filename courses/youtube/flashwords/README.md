**NOTE(S)**:   

I've only started working on this VueJS 'Flashwords' project, today, during this Sunday evening...;    
many projects I *start*...; but, don't actually ever tend to **finish**...;    
so, I really don't know for sure if I'll be able to complete doing this YouTube project course...???   

However, I am very deeply impressed with the really clear and simple 'in depth' explanations  
that this lady gives to accompany her videos...;     
so, I decided to engage with it 'hands on'...    
in order to learn more about how the VueJS framework platform works.   

Project start date: *Sun 20 Oct 2024 19:49 PM GMT*    
Project end date:
